# AntiCoords
Some bad sketchy codes which runs with lambda plugin\
that tries to block the coordinate leak by your chat\
Compatible with baritone(Maybe)
## DetectMode
Strict : will block it if there's any nunber on your chat\
Smart : Using regex "(\s*-?\d+){2,4}+" to block 2~4 Number String(ex : 61732 63 -13537) in your chat
## Something Miscellaneous
I'm really new with kotlin(java) and minecraft mod things so It may occur some unknown errors,\
And i just copy and paste my source code to [ExamplePlugin](https://github.com/lambda-client/ExamplePlugin) (Because there were some other miscellaneous file in my project folder) so building may not be work :(

   do you have some better regex then can send it to me to improve it
