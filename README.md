# AntiCoords
Some bad sketchy codes which runs with lambda plugin\
that tries to block the coordinate leak by your chat\
Compatible with baritone(Maybe)
## DetectMode
Strict : will block it if there's any number on your chat\
Smart : Using regex "(\s*-?\d+){2,4}+" to block 2~4 Number String(ex : 61732 63 -13537) in your chat
## Something Miscellaneous
I'm really new with kotlin(java) and minecraft mod things, so It may occur some unknown errors.

do you have some better regex then can send it to me to improve it
